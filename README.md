# Document RAG System 

Document-aware LLM backend built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system ingests documents, extracts and chunks text, embeds content into a vector database, retrieves relevant context for a query, and constrains the LLM to answer strictly from retrieved documents via a FastAPI API.

This project focuses on system design, retrieval quality, and controlled generation rather than UI.
